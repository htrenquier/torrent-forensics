    <h2>SESSIONS EP</h2>
    <h3>The Free BitTorrent™ Bundle</h3>
    KRANE is on his way to being a household name in the electronic world, as he continues to impress us with his hard-hitting beats. As a producer, his distinct trap-to-futurist sound has attracted a solid following along the way. His list of collaborations carries producer-heavyweights such as, Keys N Krates, Ekali, Alexander Lewis, Quix and more, while adding his own twist to some contemporary electronic classics including Jai Wolf's "Drive" and most recently his single with Keys N Krates themselves, with “Right Here”. His glowing sound is cinematic, as he uses spacious synths in vivacious atmospheres. 

Today, KRANE continues his celebrated SESSIONS ‘collaborative platform’ with its first full-length EP installment, featuring 8 new singles...

“SESSIONS, is a way for me and my community of producers to collaborate on tracks, and influence each others production styles – it is a project where I’m going to try and work with as many of you as I have time. No matter what the size or style, and help get you the attention your art deserves.”
